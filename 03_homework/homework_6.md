**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

I worked for a company that grab the data of people's mobile phone location and track their daily activity so you basically know where this person are from morning to night and where do they stay during night. The whole purpose of this data collection is for marketing research, these are very personal information and in order to protect the privacy of the user, they actually comes up way to deidentify the data so all data become anonymous, so it is safe to use.

To keep the ethics you just make sure you don't inadvertently reveal sensitive information, violate privacy rights, or contribute to unethical practices such as discriminatory targeting or profiling. Don't touch data that you are not supposed to know.

Not too much experience dealing with inequity though, just do your best and fight for your rights, be dare to speak up and look for help.
